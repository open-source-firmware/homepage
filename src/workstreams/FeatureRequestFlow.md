We are currently working on developing a Feature Request and Implementation Process that aims to provide a structured
workflow for managing feature requests in open-source projects. This process will ensure smoother collaboration between 
businesses and community developers while maintaining the flexibility of open-source development.

The goal is to create a process that minimizes fragmentation, allowing businesses to request and implement features in a
way that benefits both them and the open-source community. If you want to get involved in this effort, reach out to

## Goals 

- Develop a transparent, easy-to-follow workflow for feature requests.
- Ensure businesses and the community can collaborate efficiently.
- Avoid the creation of fragmented forks by encouraging upstream development.
- Balance business needs with the open-source ethos.
