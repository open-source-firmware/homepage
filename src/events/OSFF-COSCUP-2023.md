This year the OSFF will host the "Open-Source Firmware Track" at the COSCUP'23 in Taipei, Taiwan. The Conference for Open Source Coders, Users and Promoters (COSCUP) is an annual conference held by the open-source community in Taipei. It is a two day conference full with talks, and sponsor and community booths.

This is the first time that COSCUP is hosting an open-source firmware track - and we are very proud that we are allowed to run it.
