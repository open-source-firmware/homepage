The Open Source Firmware Day @ RUB, held at Ruhr University Bochum, brought together students, industry experts, and the open-source community to explore and promote firmware development. Organized by Fachschaft IT-Sicherheit, 9elements Cyber Security, and the Open Source Firmware Foundation, the event featured insightful talks by prominent figures such as Vincent Zimmer and Subrata Banik, hands-on workshops on coreboot with HARDKERNEL odroid, and interactive hacking sessions. Over 70 attendees participated in discussions, learned about firmware security, and connected with experienced developers, fostering a collaborative and supportive community atmosphere.

Aligned with the theme "Back to the Root," the event highlighted the importance of cultivating a new generation of open-source firmware enthusiasts. The collaborative efforts of sponsors like HGI, CASA, and the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy, alongside workshops led by Leon Groß and Maximilian Brune, underscored the community’s commitment to innovation and education. This initiative promises a brighter future for the open-source firmware landscape by empowering younger generations with knowledge, tools, and inspiration to shape the next 25 years of development.
