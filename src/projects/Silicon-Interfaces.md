Integrating binary blobs that handle parts of the silicon initialization is a common technique within the open-source firmware ecosystem to retain control over parts of the code, from a SoC vendor perspective. Within the last years multiple SoC vendors defined different interfaces to communicate to those "silicon initialization code". Also different mechanisms are in place to configures those.

The *Silicon Interface Design* workstream has the goal to unify these interfaces and define a specification around it so that SoC vendors and (open-source) firmware projects, and their developers, have a fixed and common way to interact and configure those silicon initialization code.
